Navigating This Book
====================

This book is designed to be read front to back. I specifically layout out the
sections in a logical manner where one chapter builds off the previous. There
are a few exceptions to this however.

The *Command & Control* section should be read in order. These sections
specifically build one atop the other, and make logical sense in this order. To
skip around within this section would likely cause some confusion.

The other sections could be used as reference sections, after the *Command &
Control* section has been read. Once the foundation is laid, the other sections
in this book will make more sense. Again, it is important that the *Command &
Control* section be read in its proper order, and then the rest of the book can
be taken as needed.
