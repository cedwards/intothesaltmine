Who Should Read This Book
=========================

This book is for those people wanting to improve the way that they manage their
systems. From top to bottom this book will guide you through the necesarry
steps required to fundamentally change the way that you manage your entire
system lifecycle. Sound too good to be true? It's really not. Every now and
then someone among us challenges the status quo and forges new ground in the
digital world. SaltStack is just that. A fundamental change in the way we will
manage our digital real estate.

If you're already familiar with SaltStack and simply want to dive deeper Into
The Salt Mine, this is the place. My goal here is to describe SaltStack in a
modular, bottom-up approach, giving a better overall vision of what is
possible. I guarantee you'll learn something new about SaltStack by reading
this book.
