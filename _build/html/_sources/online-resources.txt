The official Salt documentation is a very good resource for detailed
information about modules, states, general configuration and tutorials. Much of
that information was used as a reference in writing this book. This
documentation can be found at:

The official SaltStack blog can be a good resource for upcoming events,
including trainings, conferences and meetups. This can also be a good resource
for enterprise use cases and links to other related publications. This blog can
