Introduction
============

In this chapter you'll learn how to configure and run a Salt-based secret
storage solution. This will give you the ability to store different type of 
data in a GPG encrypted key-value storage, and query this data from minion
systems. You will have the ability to limit which systems have access to data,
as well as limit access on a per-user basis.

The components outlined in this chapter require Salt version 2014.7.0 or later.
